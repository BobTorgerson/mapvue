    abstract: '## What areas of the Arctic are &ldquo;important&rdquo;? One challenge that managers and policy makers often face is the conflict of interests among groups. This was evident when the [Scenarios Network for Alaska and Arctic Planning](https://www.snap.uaf.edu) was asked to identify specific geographic â€œareas of environmental, economic, and cultural importanceâ€ in Arctic Alaska for a 2013 report to the President of the United states on [Integrated Arctic Management (IAM)](https://www.afsc.noaa.gov/publications/misc_pdf/iamreport.pdf). While many groups have an answer to this question, the answer depends on the perspective and interests of the group. As a proof of concept, SNAP took an objective approach to identifying important areas by displaying existing geospatial datasets that fit into the environmental, economic, and cultural categories to see where they overlap. Based upon available data, this can illustrate the relative importance of those areas, identify potential areas of conflict, and highlight gaps in Arctic geospatial data. ',
